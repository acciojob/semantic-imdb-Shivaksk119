			<h2>Favorite quote:</h2>
			<p>If someone was going to hell, Kundavai would stop him and take him to heaven. Thatâ€™s one kind of power. But do you know what Nandini would do? It must be said that her power goes a step further. She would convince him that hell is heaven, and make him jump happily into hell!</p>
