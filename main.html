			<h2>Favorite quote:</h2>
			<p>If someone was going to hell, Kundavai would stop him and take him to heaven. 
				That’s one kind of power. But do you know what Nandini would do? It must be said 
				that her power goes a step further. She would convince him that hell is heaven, 
				and make him jump happily into hell!</p>
